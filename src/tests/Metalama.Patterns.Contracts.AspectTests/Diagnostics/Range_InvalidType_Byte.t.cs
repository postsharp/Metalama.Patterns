// Warning LAMA5007 on `GreaterThan( 256 )`: `The meaning of the [GreaterThanAttribute] attribute on Range_InvalidType_Byte.field is ambiguous because the inequality strictness is not specified. It is now interpreted as NonStrict, which is non-standard, and this behavior might be changed in the future. Use either [GreaterThanOrEqualAttribute] or [StrictlyGreaterThanAttribute] or specify the DefaultInequalityStrictness property in ContractOptions using the ConfigureContracts fabric extension method.`
// Error LAMA5001 on `field`: `The [GreaterThan] contract cannot be applied to 'Range_InvalidType_Byte.field' because the value range [256, âˆž] cannot be satisfied by the type Byte.`
